# learning-react
A series to learn React!

## Part 1 - Introduction/Taster

This first session will be a super quick shallow dive into what **React** is and what you can do with it - by the end of it _everyone_ should have built _some_ UI (or it could go chaotically wrong, who knows!). It is very much a taster and hopefully catered to people at all levels.

**I would recommend people get into pairs to work through the problems which will come up, ideally where half the pair has some engineering experience to help the newcomers!**

Before we begin please make sure you (your pair) follow these steps...

1. Ensure you have **node** (>=v6) installed on your machine. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository somewhere on your machine (use the [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't want to setup **git**)
3. Ensure you have your [editor](https://www.sublimetext.com) setup and ready to start hacking on the `/part-1` directory.
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the `/part-1` directory.

Give someone a shout in #learning-react slack channel if you need some help setting up!
